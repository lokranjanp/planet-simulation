Simulating orbits and behaviour of solar system using PyGame module by scaling down distances and time durations

The simulation model uses real physics concepts and mathematical equations to calculate real time gravitational forces of the system of planets and updates the position by using newton's laws of gravitation. 

The motivation for this simulation was from an article : https://fiftyexamples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gravity.html

Pygame and the math modules in python is used mainly for the GUI and in - simulation calculations.
The simulation takes into account only the first 4 planets of the solar system and also the Sun. 
A fully fledged simulation will be made shortly.
